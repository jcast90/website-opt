I used different methods in order to speed up the load time of this website.
-Inline CSS
-Inline some of the script
-Created global variables for loops so the page wouldnt have to reload the style or layout through each loop
-loaded the font with WebFont.load, speed up font load time
-compressed an image and size to load faster
-made the pizza resize faster
-fixed the janky pizzas with the scroll event
